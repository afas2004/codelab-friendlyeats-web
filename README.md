PROJECT BACKGROUND: This project, named as Friendly Chat Web App, is a development project using 
Google Firebase as backend platform. We are using google codelab as a guidance and tutorial as step-by-step 
instructions. By integrating VS Code, Firebase and Github, we finally have developed an app for chat which 
functions for texts and images. 

Discussions: 
This project has given me many insights, knowledge and skills throughout its development.
This journey of codelab is not possible without our lecturer, Sir Atif, who is teaching us 
the basics of basics in developing an application which in this case is a web application.
There are lots of things that happen and Sir Atif has helped alongside each time. 

The first thing is about Github. It is a new experience using such a big platform. 
Github surely was introduced as a home for developers to get sample code for their projects. 
Setting the Github accounts is already confusing as it gets but remoting repositories is 
another hurdle that I am glad I have overcome. Those commands such as git init, git remote origin,
git clone etc, are really a work for me to remember. Not to mention the setup on VS Code is also 
such a chore that takes a whole two hours. Anyway, the first time is always hard, they say.

Next, about Firebase from Google. Our project is using AngularFire Firebase. 
The setup on the website is not as problematic compared to the coding side. 
We are using the free version, although the codelab did ask us to subscribe for upgrading our firebase. 
The toughest thing about firebase is its version and local hosting. It took a solid class with two hours 
just to update the angular versions including its cli, core and so on. I had my laptop crash because the 
storage was full. Luckily I have another one which I am using now for writing this for submitting the report. 

Lastly, this project gives me a lot of hassle and also knowledge, even though we are just copying 
the codelab instructions. Switching to another device midway through the development also is a 
headache for me, because I had to start all over from scratch. Either way, I am able to complete 
this project on time and hopefully I can get a better device next time. One more time, I am really 
grateful toward our lecturer for his commitment and kindness for extending this report submission 
amidst the busy week. I hope that this project will become my motivation in some other day of my 
degree career.
